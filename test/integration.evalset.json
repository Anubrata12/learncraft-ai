It's like a puzzle where you figure out the missing numbers!\n\n2. In algebra, letters and symbols stand for numbers. These numbers can be known (like 2 or 5) or unknown (represented by letters like 'x' or 'y').\n\n3. The letters used in algebra are called variables. They can represent different values, and the goal is often to find out what those values are.\n\n4. An equation is a mathematical statement that shows two things are equal. It has an equals sign (=) in the middle. For example, '2 + 2 = 4' is an equation.\n\n5. The main goal in algebra is to find the value of unknown variables in an equation. This means figuring out what number a letter (like 'x') represents.\n\n6. You use all the basic math operations in algebra: addition (+), subtraction (–), multiplication (×), and division (÷).\n\n7. If x + 3 = 7, then x = 4. You can find this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation."
